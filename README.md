### Backstabbr convoy demo

## Setup
Here, Russia is positioned to convoy its army from Livonia, across the Gulf of Bothnia into Sweden.

## The orders
To do so, Russia will need to order:
  1) LVN army to *move* from LVN to SWE
  2) BOT fleet to *convoy* the LVN army to SWE
These orders will be executed simultaneously, so it doens't matter what sequence of orders you input (i.e. on a given turn, 1) then 2) is identical to 2) then 1)).

## Executing the orders
I'll explain the orders in the sequence they're listed, but note that they can be entered in either sequence.

1) To order the LVN army to move
    i) simply click the army

  ii) then click the destination.

3) To order the BOT fleet to convyoy
    i) simply click the fleet,

  ii) then press the blue *convoy* button. Backstabbr now tells you what to input next:

**N.B.:** look here for instructions whenever you're confused while executing orders. 
  
  iii) to summarize what backstabbr directs you to do: now, you just replicate your orders to the LVN army (i.e. click LVN then SWE)
